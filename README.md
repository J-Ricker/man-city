Hello!

This was one of my BIGGEST projects in React.

That being said it isnt perfect, but it did take a lot of hard work and I want to help you explore as much of it as I can here!

For starters: 

This project uses Routes!(ooooooooo crazy right?), authentication, and storage/deployement on Firebase!

I want you to be able to see all of the site, so I am going to provide the login infromation to see the dashboard and the admin side of the site using this path: 

https://man-city-76299.firebaseapp.com (This is the full site)

https://man-city-76299.firebaseapp.com/sign-in (this is the way to the admin section!)

Username: test1@gmail.com
Password: password123

(there is no private information on the database or the site so providing the info doesnt do anything but give you a better experience!)

Using the information provided above is the best way to get the most out of viewing this project.

You can:

Edit/add players
Edit/add matches
Upload pictures! (WHOA)
Filter through matches thathave been played, won, lost, and have gone to a draw.
There is even a promotion near the bottom to win a jersey!(I know its not real but its ok to get excited :D)


THANK YOU!



















This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
